WebGL Deferred Shading
======================

**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, Project 6**

* (TODO) YOUR NAME HERE
* Tested on: (TODO) **Google Chrome 222.2** on
  Windows 22, i7-2222 @ 2.22GHz 22GB, GTX 222 222MB (Moore 2222 Lab)


### (TODO: Your README)


Instructions (delete me)
========================

This is due at midnight on the evening of **INSTRUCTOR TODO**.

**Summary:** **INSTRUCTOR TODO**.

**Recommendation:**
Take screenshots as you go. Use them to document your progress in your README!

### Contents

* `js/`: **INSTRUCTOR TODO**

### Running the code

If you have Python, you should be able to run `server.js` to start a server.
Then, open [`http://localhost:10565/`](http://localhost:10565/) in your browser.

Google Chrome works best.
If you have problems running the starter code, make sure you have:

* Updated version of your browser
* Updated video drivers

## Requirements

**Ask on the mailing list for any clarifications.**

In this project, you are given the following code:

* a

You will need to implement the following features:

* a

You are also required to implement at least X "points" worth in extra features.
(point values are given in parentheses):

* a

This extra feature list is not comprehensive. If you have a particular idea
that you would like to implement, please **contact us first** (preferably on
the mailing list).

**IMPORTANT:**
For each feature (required or extra), please provide the following brief analysis:

* Concise overview write-up of the feature.
* Performance impact of adding the feature (whether slower or faster).
* If you did something to accelerate the feature, what did you do and why?
* How might this feature be optimized beyond your current implementation?

## Third-Party Code Policy

* Use of any third-party code must be approved by asking on our Google Group.
* If it is approved, all students are welcome to use it. Generally, we approve
  use of third-party code that is not a core part of the project. For example,
  for the path tracer, we would approve using a third-party library for loading
  models, but would not approve copying and pasting a CUDA function for doing
  refraction.
* Third-party code **MUST** be credited in README.md.
* Using third-party code without its approval, including using another
  student's code, is an academic integrity violation, and will, at minimum,
  result in you receiving an F for the semester.


## README

Replace the contents of this README.md in a clear manner with the following:

* A brief description of the project and the specific features you implemented.
* At least one screenshot of your project running.
* A 20+ second video of your project running.
* A performance analysis (described below).

### Performance Analysis
